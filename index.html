                <p>
                    Music is an art concerned with combining vocal or instrumental sounds for beauty of form or emotional expression, usually according to cultural standards of rhythm, melody, and, in most Western music, harmony. May it be a folk song or an electronic composition, it is all music. Throughout its history, music has gone through quite a lot of transformations and has adopted different styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music blends into words and even with physical movements like dance. With the growth in civilization, music has been put into use in many fields. Be it religious rituals, psychotherapy or entertainment.Beyond all this, the teaching of music in primary and secondary schools has now attained virtually worldwide acceptance.

                <h1>Things you should know about musical instruments</h1>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>
                    Musical instrument is any device for producing a musical sound. The principal types of such instruments are classified by the method of producing sound, are percussion, stringed, keyboard, wind, and electronic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As to the origin of musical instruments, however, there can be only conjecture. Whatever their origin, the further development of the enormously varied instruments of the world has been dependent on the interplay of four factors: available material, technological skills, mythic and symbolic preoccupations, and patterns of trade and migration. Thus, residents of Arctic regions use bone, skin, and stone to construct instruments; residents of the tropics have wood, bamboo, and reed available; while societies with access to metals and the requisite technology are able to utilize these malleable materials in a variety of ways. Myth and symbolism play an equally important role. Herding societies, for example, which may depend on a particular species of animal not only economically but also spiritually, often develop instruments that look or sound like the animal or prefer instruments made of bone and hide rather than stone and wood, even when all the materials are available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sound produced by an instrument can be affected by many factors, including the material from which the instrument is made, its size and shape, and the way that it is played.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first step in the building of any instrument is the selection and preparation of material. Next, the construction and tuning of all instruments require skill and craftsmanship.The mathematical basis of accurate tuning systems has been the subject of philosophical and scientific speculation since ancient times. All practical tuning systems involve a series of compromises, a fact that instrument makers have known for centuries.The instrument maker’s skill was developed by long practice, and the principles that determine both tone and intonation were discovered by trial and error.Modern technology has in many cases simplified or improved the construction of instruments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instruments have been classified in various ways, some of which overlap. The following are the kinds of musical instruments classified by taking all the theories into consideration (this also includes the vocal types).
