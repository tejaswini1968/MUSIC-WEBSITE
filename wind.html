                Since the prehistoric flutes and whistles made from animal vones or hollow plants, an amazing variety of wind instruments have developed. Known as aerophones, they are played by blowing into or across holes in a tube, or on a single or double reed attached to a mouthpiece. The pitch of the note is fixed by the length of the tube and the number of opoen holes. Many modern woodwind instruments, such as the flute and clarinet, are formed by fitting together shorter section of tube (joints) to form one longer tube. In the woodwind section of an orchestra, the instruments range from the tiny piccolo to the large bassoon and contrabassoon.

                        The clarinet is a versatile woodwind instrument. Its warm tone and expressive capabilities are suited to a variety of musical styles, including classical and jazz. The large clarinet family ranges from the contrabass, which plays the lowest range of notes, to the piccolo clarinet, which plays the highest. Like the saxophone, the clarinet is a single reed instrument. Players blow into the narrow gap between the reed and mouthpiece causing the reed to vibrate and produce a sound. The modern clarinet uses a system of rings and keys, to allow the clarinettist to play a wide range of notes. There are four main sections that make up the clarinet (from top to bottom): the barrel, upper joint, lower joint, and bell. The standard clarinet is in B flat and is used in most styles of music. Clarinets are also made in A, which are more often used in orchestras and chamber music.

                        The largest instrument of the woodwind family with the lowest pitch, the bassoon uses a double reed, made from two pieces of cane tied together. The bassoon is played in a similar way to the oboe. The bassoonist presses the reed between the lips and blows to sound the instrument. The reed is connected to the body of the instrument by a curved metal tube, called a crook. There are four sections, or joints, of a bassoon that fit together (from top to bottom): the bell, bass, wing, and butt. A complex system of keys is controlled by the player's hands to produce different notes.

                        The modern metal flute has its roots in the simple instruments made of bone, wood, or clay that were played by our ancestors thousands of years ago. Now a finely honed metal instrument, the flute's smooth, bright sound can be heard at the top of the woodwind section. In the 19th century, instrument makers began experimenting with key systems in the search for a more powerful flute, with more reliable tuning. A flute-maker called Theobald Boehm invented a system that is still used on most modern flutes today. The modern flute has just over three octaves and is usually pitched in C. There are larger, lower-pitched flutes (alto) and smaller, high-pitched ones (the piccolo). Standard C-pitched instruments are formed of three sections (joints) that fit together: the head, body, and foot. Flutes are widely played in classical music, as well as jazz and traditional Celtic music, for which softer-toned wooden insturments are preffered.

                        Recorders are among the earliest woodwind instruments and are forerunners of the modern flute. The recorder has a mouthpiece and is played like a whislte, by blowing directly into the top of the instrument. It is a simple wooden tube, usually with eight fingerholes, which are covered to produce different notes. At the mouthpiece, a wooden block (called a fipple) directs the air. Recorderss were popular during the Baroque period (1600-1750), when they formed part of consorts (small groups of instruments). They are made in range of sizes, from the small, very high-pitched sopranino to the large and low-pitched bass. Most modern recorders have three sections, called joints, that fit together: the head, body, and foot.

                        The oboe is a double-reed woodwind instrument. It is a long wooden tube that flares out at the end. To produce a sound, the oboist places the tip of the reed (made from a bamboo-like cane) between the lips and blows into the tiny hole. Many oboists make their own reeds, as each player needs a slightly different form. The oboe has a range a little lower than that of the flute. It is a key part of the orchestral woodwind section and is also a solo instrument in its own right.

                        Originally invented more than 150 years ago in Paris for use in military bands and orchestras, this impressive woodwind instrument, usually made of brass and more popularly known as the sax, was never really taken up by composers as an orchestral instrument. Instead, it was embraced wholeheartedly by jazz and swing bands, becoming popular as a solo instrument, and today, plays a part in most styles of music. Adolphe Sax invented 14 different saxophones that were divied into seven types (from smallest to largest): sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, bass, and contrabass. They all have the keys in the same place, so once you can play one, you should be able to play them all!
